# Demo Script & Elevator Pitch — Vision Agent

---

## 🎬 2-Minute Demo Script (for video recording or live judges)

### 0:00–0:10 — INTRO
> "Hi, I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — a Class 12 student from India. This is Vision Agent v2.0, a real-time multimodal AI platform built for the Vision Possible hackathon."

*[Show: Platform landing page with cosmic dark theme, all 17 tabs visible]*

---

### 0:10–0:30 — PLATFORM OVERVIEW
> "It combines live video + audio processing, YOLOv8 for detection & pose estimation, and a 7-tier LLM cascade so the agent always has an answer — even if the primary API is down."

*[Show: Click through tab bar to show all 17 tabs. Point to the 'Online · ollama' badge and 'GLM-5' model indicator]*

---

### 0:30–0:55 — POSE COACH DEMO
> "Here's the AI Pose Coach. I select 'Squat', start the camera, and the AI watches my exercise in real-time — counting reps, measuring joint angles, and speaking posture corrections aloud."

*[Show: Pose Coach tab → Select exercise → Start Camera → Demonstrate a squat → Show joint angle gauge moving → Rep counter incrementing → Voice coach speaking]*

---

### 0:55–1:20 — LIVE STREAM + DETECTION
> "The Live Stream tab streams from your webcam. Every 2 seconds it runs YOLO inference — bounding boxes, object labels, and the agent reasons about what it sees. Real-time metrics show chunks processed, latency, and model FPS."

*[Show: Live Stream tab → Start Stream → Wave objects in front of camera → Show bounding boxes appearing → Point to metrics panel (chunks, latency, objects)]*

---

### 1:20–1:40 — AGENT CHAT + SMART FEATURES
> "After analyzing, I can ask the Agent Chat anything about the video. It gives an instant FastReply from YOLO labels, then a polished LLM answer. We also have auto-generated quizzes, AI study notes, and URL ingestion — paste a YouTube link, and it analyzes automatically."

*[Show: Agent Chat → type question → see 2-tier response. Quick flash: Quiz tab, AI Notes tab, Ingest URL tab]*

---

### 1:40–1:55 — SECURITY + DASHBOARD
> "The Security Camera provides real-time threat alerts. The Crowd Monitor tracks density and safety. And the Performance Dashboard shows the LLM cascade health, API latency, and session uptime — all live."

*[Show: Security Cam tab → Crowd Monitor → Dashboard with latency chart and cascade status]*

---

### 1:55–2:00 — CLOSE
> "Vision Agent — 17 AI tabs, 22 SDK modules, 37 API endpoints, completely open-source. I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — thanks to WeMakeDevs and Stream for this amazing hackathon!"

*[Show: GitHub URL on screen: github.com/rupac4530-creator/vision-agent]*

## ⚡ 30-Second Elevator Pitch

> "Vision Agent is a production-grade multimodal AI platform that watches live video, understands action, and responds in real time. It provides pose coaching with rep counting, security alerts, live detection overlays, AI study notes, interactive quizzes, and a 7-tier LLM cascade for reliable conversation — all packaged as a 17-tab open-source platform with 22 SDK modules, built by a Class 12 student for his very first hackathon."
