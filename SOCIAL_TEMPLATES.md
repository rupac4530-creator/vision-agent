🚀 **Vision Agent — Real-Time Multimodal AI Platform**

A camera with a brain: real-time YOLO detection, fitness coaching (7 exercises), 2-tier agent intelligence (<500ms), voice feedback, and a premium UI with 3D effects.

🔗 **Repo**: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/vision-agent
🎥 **Demo**: [YOUR_DEMO_VIDEO_URL]

**What it does:**
• Live webcam/screen streaming with instant YOLOv8 bounding box overlays
• Fitness coach: squat, push-up, lunge, plank, jumping jack, shoulder press — with rep counting, streak tracking, and voice cues
• 2-tier agent: FastReply <500ms + deep LLM PolishReply with provenance
• Video upload → transcript → detection → AI notes → quiz
• URL ingestion (YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter)
• Cascade LLM: Gemini → OpenAI → Cloudflare → local fallback
• Screen share, audio visualizer, keyboard shortcuts, confetti celebrations

**Tech stack:** Python, FastAPI, YOLOv8, MediaPipe, Whisper, Gemini, OpenAI, Canvas API, SpeechSynthesis, Vision Agents SDK

Built solo for the Vision Possible hackathon 💪

🎬 Just submitted my project for the Vision Possible: Agent Protocol Hackathon by WeMakeDevs + Stream!

I built Vision Agent — a real-time multimodal AI platform that turns any camera into an intelligent observer, coach, and advisor.

What it can do:
🔍 Real-time YOLOv8 object detection with bounding box overlays
🏋️ Fitness coaching across 7 exercises with rep counting and voice feedback
🤖 2-tier agent intelligence: instant reply (<500ms) + deep LLM analysis
📊 Live metrics dashboard: latency, FPS, detections
🖥️ Screen share support — analyze anything on your screen
🎙️ Audio transcription, AI notes, interactive quizzes

The architecture uses a cascade LLM system (Gemini → OpenAI → Cloudflare Workers AI → local fallback) so it never fails — even without internet.

The frontend is zero-dependency (pure HTML/CSS/JS) with premium animations: 3D card tilt, shooting stars, confetti celebrations, and glassmorphism dark theme.

Tech: Python, FastAPI, YOLOv8, MediaPipe, OpenAI Whisper, Gemini, Canvas API, SpeechSynthesis API

```
Subject: Vision Agent — Vision Possible Hackathon Submission

Hi WeMakeDevs Team,

I'm submitting my project for the Vision Possible: Agent Protocol Hackathon.

Project: Vision Agent — Real-Time Multimodal AI Platform
Repo: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/vision-agent
Demo Video: [YOUR_DEMO_VIDEO_URL]

Vision Agent transforms any camera into an intelligent observer. Key highlights:

1. Real-time streaming with YOLOv8 detection and bounding box overlays
2. Fitness coaching across 7 exercises (squat, push-up, lunge, plank, jumping jack, shoulder press) with rep counting, streak tracking, and browser voice feedback
3. 2-tier agent intelligence: instant FastReply (<500ms) + deep LLM PolishReply with provenance links
4. Cascade LLM architecture: Gemini → OpenAI → Cloudflare Workers AI → local fallback
5. Full video pipeline: upload → transcription → detection → AI notes → interactive quiz
6. Premium UI: 3D card tilt, animated gradients, shooting stars, confetti celebrations
7. Screen share support, audio visualization, keyboard shortcuts

Tech: Python/FastAPI, YOLOv8, MediaPipe, OpenAI Whisper, Gemini, Vision Agents SDK

The project is designed to work offline with graceful fallbacks, making it reliable for any demo environment.

Thank you for organizing this incredible hackathon!

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]

## 6. BLOG POST SUMMARY (For the $500 Blog Category)

If you want to submit a blog post (hosted on LinkedIn, Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium), here's an outline:

```
Title: "Building a Camera with a Brain: Real-Time Vision AI in Under a Week"

Sections:
1. The Problem — Why cameras are still "dumb"
2. The Solution — Vision Agent architecture overview
3. Deep Dive: Real-Time Streaming
   - WebM chunk strategy
   - Growing-file decoding
   - 2-second processing pipeline
4. Deep Dive: 2-Tier Agent Intelligence
   - FastReply (<500ms, deterministic)
   - PolishReply (LLM, async, provenance)
5. Deep Dive: Fitness Coaching
   - MediaPipe pose estimation
   - Joint angle computation
   - State machine for 7 exercises
   - Streak tracking and motivational cues
6. The Cascade LLM Strategy
   - Gemini → OpenAI → Cloudflare → local
