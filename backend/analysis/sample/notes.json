    "summary": "This lecture covers Newton's three laws of motion in classical mechanics. The first law (law of inertia) describes how objects maintain their state unless acted upon by external forces. The second law, F = ma, provides the fundamental quantitative relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. The third law establishes that forces always come in equal and opposite pairs. The lecture applies these principles to the inclined plane problem, decomposing gravitational force into components to derive equations of motion.",
